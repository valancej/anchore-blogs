# Introduction to Kubernetes Security

## Background

Over the past several of years the software community has seen the rise of [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). First developed by Google, Kubernetes is the most popular open-source container management tool which automates container deployment, container scaling, and container load balancing. A few of the major features and benefits of Kubernetes are: Automatic Binpacking, Service Discovery & Load Balancing, Storage Orchestration, Self Healing, Horizonal Scaling, etc. Kubernetes is backed back a large community and hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/). When organizations beginning to increase their use of containers begin to run into challenges with automated scaling up and down, container management and deployment, distributing load between containers, it generally becomes necesary to implement a container orchestration platform to reduce operational burden.
