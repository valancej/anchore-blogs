## Whitelisting in Anchore

At Anchore, we are consistently working with our users and customers to help them gain better insight into the contents of their container images, and more importantly, helping them specify rules to enforce security, compliance, and best practices. This is done through Anchore policy evaluations, and more specifically, the rules are definied within a the policies component of a policy bundle. Anchore policy bundles are the unit of policy definition and evaluation. Anchore users may have multiple policy bundlesm, but for a policy evaluation, the user must specify a bundle to be evaluated or default to the bundle currently marked as active. One of the components of a policy bundle is whitelists. A whitelist is a set of exclusion rules for trigger matches found during policy evaluation. A whitelist defines a specific gate and trigger_id that should have it's action statically set to **_go_**. When a policy result is whitelisted, it is still present in the output of the policy evaluation, but it's action is set to **_go_** and it is indicated that there was a whitelist match. The overarching idea though, is to give developers, ops, and security team members an effective mechanism for ignoring vulnerability matches that are known to be false positive, or ignoring vulnerabilities on specific packages (if they have been patched), or any other agreed upon reason for creating a whitelist rule.
