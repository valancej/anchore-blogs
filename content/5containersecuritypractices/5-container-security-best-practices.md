# 5 Best Practices for Container Image Security

In this post, I wanted to identify a few high-level security tips and best practices to consider when working with container images. Before diving into that, a very brief summary on the advantages of **containers**: Containers help organizations become more consistent, agile, and secure. These advantages are highlighted by allowing developers select the tools and environments that best suit their projects and applications. For operations teams, they now can focus on delivering these applications in a consistent and reliable way across multiple environments. 

Now that we are clear on some of the high-level advantages, I will detail what a **container image** is. A container image is a collection of data that includes all files, software packages, and metadata needed to create a running instance of a container. In essence, an image is a template from which a container can be instantiated. Images are immutable, meaning, once theyâ€™ve been built, they cannot be changed. If someone were to make a change, a new image would be built as a result.
